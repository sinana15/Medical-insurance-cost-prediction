Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

I used Python to predict medical insurance costs based on personal data.

MY GOAL

python:The programming language

pandas:To read and clean the data

seaborn:To draw graphs and see the data

scikit-learn:To build the machine learning model

What I Found

Smoking is expensive:Smoker pay much more for insurance

Age matters:Older people pay more

BMI:Higher weight usually means higher cost

Model Result

I used the Linear Regression model

Accuracy:0.78
